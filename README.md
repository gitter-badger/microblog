# Microblog

This is my educational project to learn writing complete 2-tier applications with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). It implements simple microblog site (aka _Twitter clone_) as backend tier ([Flask-RESTful](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-RESTful/) + [PeeWee ORM](https://pypi.org/project/peewee/) + [Marshmallow](https://pypi.org/project/marshmallow/)) and frontend tier ([Preact](https://preactjs.com/) + [Redux-Zero](https://github.com/redux-zero/redux-zero) + [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter)).

## Learning goals

* clean backend API design
* secure implementation of JWT based authentication on frontend
* learn structuring UI with components
* familiarize with current Javascript techniques
* familiarize with frontend programming concepts using React/Preact

## Ultimate goal

Deploy complete site to one of my VPS hosts and write series of tutorials.
